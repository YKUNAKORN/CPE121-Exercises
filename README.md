# CPE121 Java Practice Set

## Overview
This project keeps my solutions for the CPE121 Mobile Application Development subject. It focuses on basic Java skills, clear logic, and clean console output. Every folder matches one exercise or quiz that I can run from the command line.

## Folder Guide
- `src/Main.java` – simple launcher or test space for trying code.
- `src/exercises/exercise1` – warm-up programs such as unit converters and BMI calculation.
- `src/exercises/exercise2` – math and logic drills like ISBN checks, dice guessing, and rock-paper-scissors.
- `src/exercises/exercise3` – loops and tables, including min/max finder, mileage tables, and number pyramids.
- `src/quizzes` – extra practice or graded tasks (placeholder for now).

## Requirements
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or newer.
2. Any IDE or text editor that supports Java (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).

## How to Run
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (my main IDE) or another editor you like.
2. In IntelliJ IDEA, right-click the file you want and choose **Run**, or use the green play icon.
3. Build the project or run the needed file from the terminal if you prefer:
	```bash
	javac src/Main.java
	java -cp src Main
	```
4. For a specific exercise, go to its package and run the file you need.

## Notes
- Code uses simple input and output to keep focus on core Java syntax.
- Comments explain only the parts that are not obvious from the code.
- Feel free to extend each exercise or add new folders for future topics.
